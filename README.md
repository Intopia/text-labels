# Accessible text labels

Demo version: https://intopia.github.io/text-labels/

If text labels are not correctly associated with their relevant form controls, assistive technology users  may not hear these text labels announced as they navigate through forms. Text labels should be programmatically associated with their form controls.

This repo tests 5 different cases.
